In this project I try to answer two questions: By looking at prior purchasing behavior can I predict what customers are likely going to order in the future? And can we perform meaningful customer segmentation by looking at purchases? I will continue to organize/update this repository with some ideas I want to try.

Two of the files are too big to be uploaded to Github. All the data files can be found here: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

Check out the PDF for my insights!
